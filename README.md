# Urban Studio - Dev Branch (Model Fine-Tuning)

![Urban Studio Logo](imgs/logo.png)

Welcome to the "Urban Studio" development branch dedicated to model fine-tuning and self-few-shot labeling for segmentation. This branch enables you to enhance the accuracy of your urban environment segmentation model through fine-tuning and self-labeling, making it even more powerful and customizable.

## Overview

In this development branch, we're focusing on improving the segmentation capabilities of Urban Studio. You can fine-tune the existing segmentation model using your own data, and also employ self-few-shot labeling to make the model more context-aware and precise in identifying urban features.

## Features

- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Customize the segmentation model using your own labeled data for better performance in urban environment analysis.

- **Self-Few-Shot Labeling**: Utilize self-few-shot labeling techniques to enhance the model's accuracy by providing context-aware labeling.

## Installation

To get started with this development branch, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone -b dev https://github.com/yourusername/urban-studio.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the application by running:

   ```bash
   python urban_studio.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Use the fine-tuning feature to load your own data and labels, and adjust the segmentation model to your specific urban environment.

2. **Self-Few-Shot Labeling**: Employ the self-few-shot labeling tool to provide additional context-aware labels for urban features to improve segmentation accuracy.

For detailed instructions and tutorials on how to use these features effectively, refer to the [documentation](#documentation).

## Contributing
